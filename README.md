#Discorder

An interactve command line discord client (Would not reccomend for use atleast before 0.1, 0.2 will be a lot more usable with history and other stuff)

Yup, very much in development.

 - Should be light on resource usage
 - Just started so not much added, and what is is somewhat buggy, see tasks.TODO for details
 - Voice support might be added laaaaaater

What works:
 - Sending/receiving messages, you will currently get all messages from the server you're on even if you haven't got that channel selected, im adding a feature to mark channels for listening
 - Sending/receiving direct messages EXCEPT for initiating new conversations
 - State will be saved when you leave and restored when you open again

Next on the list to be worked on is history, and the channel listening system mentioned above

Controlls:
 - ctrl-h: Opens help 

 - ctrl-s: Select server
 - ctrl-g: select channel 
 - ctrl-p: select private channel (direct messages)
 - escape: Quit
 - backspace: closes the active window if any

Heres an image of its current state
