Changes since 0.4:

 - Better bot account support, don't use enpoints that bots can't use
 - Deteministic random colors for channels, users and guils taken from a attribute table in a theme (see the default theme for example on how to define your own)
 - If text is longer than width, try to find whitespaces to split at before just splitting up in the middle of a word
